        Synopsis
        ========

        The scan found imports starting with 'javax.xml.bind' which indicates the usage of Java EE JAXB.

        Problem
        =======

        Jakarta XML Binding (JAXB) is a Java EE API that can marshal Java objects into XML and unmarshal XML into Java objects.
        You want use JAXB with Spring Boot.

        Solution
        ========

        The Spring Framework includes a class named Jaxb2Marshaller.
        It can both marshal and unmarshal JAXB and is the recommended way to handle JAXB in Spring applications.
        To generate JAXB classes from WSDL you can use a Gradle plugin.
