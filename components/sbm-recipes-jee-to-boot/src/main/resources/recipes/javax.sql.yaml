        Synopsis
        ========

        The scan found imports starting with 'javax.sql' which indicates the usage of JDBC in a Java EE application.

        Problem
        =======

        You are migrating a Java EE application that uses JDBC (raw SQL access) to Spring Boot.

        Solution
        ========

        Classes from javax.sql work in Spring Boot with no changes necessary.
        However, the way connections are acquired and configured is different in Spring apps.
